# Helpdesk Admin Scripts
Windows Automation Scripts for the Helpdesk Admin

Github has been a great resource for me in learning powershell, still have lots to learn but figure it's about time I stated contributing back. The plan for this repo is to clean up some of my usable scripts so it takes little or no work to implement in your own environment.
Like most other techs, I often ideas for software solutions to imrove Helpdesk and IT service delivery but don't YET have the skills to make it happen. So at some point, I may be posting the full solution or a request for help :)
