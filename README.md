# Helpdesk Admin Scripts
Windows Automation Scripts for the Helpdesk Admin

Github has been a great resource for me in learning powershell, still have lots to learn but figure it's about time I stated contributing back. The plan for this repo is to clean up some of my usable scripts to make them suitable for public consumption so it takes little or no work to implement in your own environment.
These scripts are no where near perfect but they work, so feel free to fork, modify and re-share.
If you run into issues, feel free to let me know but no guarantees.

# Projects : Printer Automation
list.txt (list of computers of servers you want to get printers from) <br/>
Get-PrinterList.ps1 (gets list of printers from one or more comptuers and stores in a CSV file) <br/>
sample-printerreport.csv (sample CSV file generated by Get-PrinterList.ps1) <br/>
Install-Printer.ps1 (prompts user to select a printer to install then installs it)<br/>
PrinterSelection (printer list that shows up when user runs Install-Printer based on the exported list)

Below is a screenshot of what you get when you run Install-Printer, once you select a printer, it gets installed
