# Helpdesk Admin Scripts
Windows Automation Scripts for the Helpdesk Admin

Github has been a great resource for me in learning powershell, still have lots to learn but figure it's about time I stated contributing back. The plan for this repo is to clean up some of my usable scripts to make them suitable for public consumption so it takes little or no work to implement in your own environment.
These scripts are no where near perfect but they work, so feel free to fork, modify and re-share.
If you run into issues, feel free to let me know but no guarantees.
